## 📘 Project Overview

The future of AI lies in **Physical AI**—systems that understand physics, interact with real environments, and operate through robotic bodies.

This book bridges the gap between:
- **Digital intelligence (LLMs, planners, perception)**
- **Physical embodiment (robots, sensors, actuators)**

Students and developers learn how to design, simulate, and deploy **autonomous humanoid robots** using modern robotics and AI tooling.

## 🧪 Development Workflow

This project follows a **Spec-Driven Development** process:

1. `/sp.constitution` – Core principles & standards  
2. `/sp.spec` – Project scope & requirements  
3. `/sp.clarify` – Resolve ambiguities  
4. `/sp.plan` – Architecture & validation strategy  
5. `/sp.tasks` – Execution breakdown  
6. AI-assisted writing + validation  
7. Docusaurus build & deployment
